# Used-car-sales
This is a data set for used car sales in the US. In total ~160k sales records over a period of 20 months in 2019 and 2020. There won't be any more updates to this dataset as eBay stopped providing full ZIP codes.
Each sample contains information about a used car sale, like selling price, location, details about the car (Make, model, year, mileage, etc).

The data was scraped from eBay
This was gotten off kaggle. Here's the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsaustin/us-used-car-sales-data)

This provides the SQL queries used for:
- Structuring the table
- Cleaning the data
- Analysing the data

The visualisations are performed through Microsoft PowerBi which paints an explanation on the used car sales which can be downloaded and viewed through [here](https://github.com/mr-williams/Used-car-sales/raw/main/used_car_analysis.pbix).
